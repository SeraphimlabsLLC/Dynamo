Railsync socket replaced wth a 5mm pin spacing to match DCC-EX.
Side-actuated boot/reset do not work well. Prefer USB programming,
but they can work with a scrap of plastic as a contact surface to actuate them. 

Consider heartbeat LED on a spare GPIO to slow flash when the device is operating correctly.

Consider status LED to MASTER_EN to show when railsync input is valid. Also status LEDs on the output enables for good measure.

All 4 outputs must be in the same mode DC or DCC. Cannot have some DCC while others in DC, DIR + OVERRIDE won't allow it.
There are additional GPIOs left, it may be possible to add a gate that blocks the incoming DCC signal on tracks in DC mode.
--Fixed in rev 0.4, additional gates added for per channel dir override.

--Fixed in rev 0.6:
Changed 5v regulator to use MLCC instead of Electrolytic for less noise. 
Added footprint for CB1 on the 3.3v just in case. Leave empty unless there is a stability problem. 
Added TVS diode to protect against overvoltage damage. Rated working up to 18v, will conduct around 20v. 
Would like to go higher, but a 24v nominal TVS might not clamp enough to stay under the 35v regulator max.
