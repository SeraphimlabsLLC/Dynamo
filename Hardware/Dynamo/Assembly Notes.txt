Fix Railsync input holes/pads to be larger so the socket installs correctly.

Replace side-actuated boot/reset, they do not work at all. I think solder heat is melting the internals.

Add status LED to MASTER_EN to show when railsync input is valid.
Consider heartbeat LED on a spare GPIO to slow flash when the device is operating correctly. 

Add gating to allow USB power input. An ideal diode will be needed between vin and the buck regulator so it can't backfeed.
